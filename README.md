## Description
With the goal of being able to have an application to write and save notes, I created a simple Note Taker. Upon opening, the user is presented with a landing page with a link to a nots page. After clicking to get to the notes page, the user is present with existing notes listed in a column on the left had side and an empty field on the right the enter a noteâ€™s title and text. After entering the text, a save button is presenting the upper right corner. After clicking save, the new note appears in the left-hand column with the existing notes. When the use clicks a note from the left-hand column, that note appears in the right with the text details present. When the use clicks the + icon in the upper right, the title and text fields clear and are ready for a new note.
